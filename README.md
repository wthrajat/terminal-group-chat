# Terminal Group Chat

Allows multiple clients to connect to the server and exchange messages with each other in real-time (in terminal duh). The clients can also join or leave a group at any time. (Made for an experiment)

# Run:

1. Compile all the java files into java classes.
2. Start the server then rest of the files.
3. Start messaging across the terminals.


### Note

This is a local network (localhost) based group chat application, it will not work over internet.

I mean it can easily but not atm. Feel free to make a PR
